# toyloc - DEPRECATED

** This code has now been ported to [morloc](https://github.com/arendsee/morloc) **

This is a toy implementation of Morloc. It is designed to test Haskell
implementation of the Morloc backend. I do not know how much I will test here
before copying over to Morlco, but I will at least get the composition parsing
in order.

Probably I will transer this to the haskell branch of the morloc repo once
I have a minimal working program.

I will begin the implementation from the annotated skeleton of the LLVM
tutorial by Stephen Diehl's, *Implementing a JIT Compiler with Haskell and
LLVM*, copied from the `compiler-practice/haskell/llvm` folder.

Toyloc is also related to Mouse, the toy compiler I wrote back when Morloc was
named Rat.
