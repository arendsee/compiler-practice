# Haskell compilers

Compilers are frequently written in Standard ML, especially in academia.
Standard ML has, I think, been used the most. OCaml and Haskell are both
descendents of Standard ML (though Haskell is a bit more removed). I have no
experience with Standard or OCaml, but have a little with Haskell. Also the
Haskell monad orientation jives well with my major current project (Morloc). So
I will go with Haskell for now.

Haskell has some pretty powerful libraries for developing compilers. Or at
least I think they are powerful (I still don't know enough to be sure, and
should compare them at some point to those of OCaml and Standard ML). The main
one (that I know of at least) is Parsec. Parsec is not a devoted compiler
maker. Rather it was designed for parsing using a parser combinator approach.
This can be powerfully adapted to writing compilers, though.

I don't really know what I am doing yet. I will update this README as I learn.
