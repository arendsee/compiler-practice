# lrparsing

`lrparsing` is a python module for parsing LR(1) grammars. I am more likely to
use it for advanced parsing (where regular expressions are not sufficient) than
for writing a serious compiler.

Full documentation for the module can be found
[here](http://lrparsing.sourceforge.net). It is worth reading, even if you
don't want to use `lrparsing`. Their strategy for explaining a deep topic is
pretty cool. They include a glossary and a 'narrative glossary'.  The narrative
glossary introduces all the terms in the glossary in a brief tutorial context.
Even within the glossary proper, the terms are contextualized by interlinking.
