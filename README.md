# Compiler practice

I am currently working on writing two compilers. Untangling their problems is
a real bitch. So I am making this repo as a sandbox for experimenting with
model problems.

When I get stuck in my main project, I will try to replicate the problem in
a toy compiler. If I can solve the problem in this simplified context, then
I can port the solution to the main project.

I will mostly be using Flex and Bison, but I may this repository isn't limited
to them.
