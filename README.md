# Compiler practice

This is a repo for practicing writing compilers. It is a place for learning the
draft, not for novel research. Mostly everything in here will be toys or pieces
of larger projects.

The folders contained each represent an approach to compiler design (or some
part of it). The two main approaches I explore are the flex-bison and
haskell-parsec combinations. The others, `arpeggio` and `lrparsing` are python
modules for parsing gramars; I explore neither in any detail.
