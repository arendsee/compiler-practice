# Haskell LLVM

This crack at Haskell compilers is based on Stephen Diehl's tutorial *Implementing a JIT Compiler with Haskell and LLVM*

I am not currently working on a compiler as low level as this (I'm am more
focusing on interpreters and code generation). So I will probably only work
through the parsing and grammer examples (chapters 2).
